# Datasets

The datasets used in the publication "Beyond the Mean-Field: Structured Deep Gaussian Processes Improve the Predictive Uncertainties"
are from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets.php) and can be downloaded from there.
A convenient way to do so might be by using or adapting the script provided [here](https://github.com/ICL-SML/Doubly-Stochastic-DGP/blob/master/demos/datasets.py).

In addition to that, data loaders for the different datasets have to be implemented as shown for the boston, energy and concrete datasets in _prepare_dataset_ in `experiments/utils/prepare_data.py`.
